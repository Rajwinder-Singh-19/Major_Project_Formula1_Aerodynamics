This repository contains the work done for the **Final Year Project** focused on the **Aerodynamic Design of an F1 Car** based on the 2026 Formula 1 regulations. The project uses advanced **CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)** simulations to optimize the aerodynamic performance of a Formula 1 car.

## Overview  

The primary goal of this project is to design, analyze, and optimize the aerodynamics of an F1 car in compliance with the 2026 regulations. Using the **Red Bull Racing RB9** model as the baseline, we performed extensive CFD simulations to refine its performance. Key aspects include validation of the simulation methodology and iterative improvements to the car's design.  

## Tasks Done So Far  

- **Baseline Model:** Modeled the **Red Bull RB9** in CAD as a starting point.  
- **CFD Simulations:** Used OpenFOAM for CFD simulation of flow around the created model  
- **Solver Validation:** Validated the CFD solver using the **Ahmed Body**, a standard benchmark in automotive aerodynamics. 

## Software and Tools  

- **CAD Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
- **CFD Tools:** OpenFOAM v2406.  
- **Post-Processing:** Kitware Paraview 5.13.1.  

## Project Methodology  

1. **Baseline Design Creation:**  
   - Modeled the Red Bull RB9 in CAD to serve as a foundation for the project.  

2. **Solver Validation:**  
   - Validated the CFD methodology using the Ahmed Body to ensure accurate results.  

3. **Aerodynamic Analysis:**  
   - Performed detailed simulations on the RB9 model.  
   - Identified regions for improvement in lift-to-drag ratio, downforce, and overall flow efficiency.  

4. **Design Optimization:**  
   - Iteratively refined the car design based on simulation results.  

5. **Regulation Check:**  
   - Ensured compliance with the 2026 F1 aerodynamic regulations.  

## Results  

- Achieved [insert notable results such as % improvement in drag, downforce increase, etc.].  
- Optimized flow behavior around the car for better aerodynamic performance.  
- Validated solver accuracy within acceptable margins of error using the Ahmed Body.  

## Future Work  

- Further optimization of specific components like front wing, rear wing, and floor.  
- Inclusion of more complex effects like tire rotation and thermal properties.  
- Application of wind tunnel data to validate simulation results.
