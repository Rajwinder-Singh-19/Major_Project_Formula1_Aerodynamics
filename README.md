This repository contains the work done for the **Final Year Project** focused on the **Aerodynamic Design of an F1 Car** based on the 2026 Formula 1 regulations. The project uses advanced **CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)** simulations to optimize the aerodynamic performance of a Formula 1 car.

## Overview  

The primary goal of this project is to design, analyze, and optimize the aerodynamics of an F1 car in compliance with the 2026 regulations. Using the **Red Bull Racing RB9** model as the baseline, we performed extensive CFD simulations to refine its performance. Key aspects include validation of the simulation methodology and iterative improvements to the car's design.  

## Tasks Done So Far  

- **Baseline Model:** Modeled the **Red Bull RB9** in CAD as a starting point.  
- **CFD Simulations:** Used OpenFOAM for meshing and CFD simulation of flow around the created model  
- **Solver Validation:** Validated the CFD solver using the **Ahmed Body**, a standard benchmark in automotive aerodynamics. 

## Software and Tools  

- **CAD Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
- **CFD Tools:** OpenFOAM v2406.  
- **Post-Processing:** Kitware Paraview 5.13

## Results and Visulizations
